Hey, welcome to the course. I hope this course provides a great learning experience!

# What is system design?

Before we start this course, let's talk about what even is system design.

System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data
for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs
of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires
a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires
us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.

## Why is System Design so important?

System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements. It is
one of the earliest decisions we can make when building a system. Often it is essential
to think from a high level as these decisions are very difficult to correct later. It
also makes it easier to reason about and manage architectural changes as the system evolves.

# IP

An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for _"Internet Protocol"_, which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network. They contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.

## Versions

Now, let's learn about the different versions of IP addresses:

### IPv4

The original Internet Protocol is IPv4 which uses a 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation that only allows for around 4 billion IP addresses. Initially, it was more than enough but as internet adoption grew, we needed something better.

_Example: `102.22.192.181`_

### IPv6

IPv6 is a new protocol that was introduced in 1998. Deployment commenced in the mid-2000s and since the internet users have grown exponentially, it is still ongoing.

This new protocol uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation. This means that IPv6 can provide about ~340e+36 IP addresses. That's more than enough to meet the growing demand for years to come.

_Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`_

## Types

Let's discuss types of IP addresses:

### Public

A public IP address is an address where one primary address is associated with your whole network. In this type of IP address, each of the connected devices has the same IP address.

_Example: IP address provided to your router by the ISP._

### Private

A private IP address is a unique IP number assigned to every device that connects to your internet network, which includes devices like computers, tablets, and smartphones, which are used in your household.

_Example: IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices._

### Static

A static IP address does not change and is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned. These addresses are usually more expensive but are more reliable.

_Example: They are usually used for important things like reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting, etc._

### Dynamic

A dynamic IP address changes from time to time and is not always the same. It has been assigned by a [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server. Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol address. They are cheaper to deploy and allow us to reuse IP addresses within a network as needed.

_Example: They are more commonly used for consumer equipment and personal use._

# OSI Model

The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. The Open System Interconnection (OSI Model) also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.

The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It's based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.

## Why does the OSI model matter?

The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model has defined the common terminology used in networking discussions and documentation. This allows us to take a very complex communications process apart and evaluate its components.

While this model is not directly implemented in the TCP/IP networks that are most common today, it can still help us do so much more, such as:

- Make troubleshooting easier and help identify threats across the entire stack.
- Encourage hardware manufacturers to create networking products that can communicate with each other over the network.
- Essential for developing a security-first mindset.
- Separate a complex function into simpler components.

## Layers

The seven abstraction layers of the OSI model can be defined as follows, from top to bottom:

![osi-model](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-I/osi-model/osi-model.png)

### Application

This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communication. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer, rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP.

### Presentation

The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. The functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/decryption, and compression.

### Session

This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources. The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints.

### Transport

The transport layer (also known as layer 4) is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to the Network layer (layer 3). It is also responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving device into data the session layer can consume.

### Network

The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender's device, and reassembles these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination this is known as routing. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary.

### Data Link

The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames.

### Physical

This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.

# TCP and UDP

## TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented, meaning once a connection has been established, data can be transmitted in both directions. TCP has built-in systems to check for errors and to guarantee data will be delivered in the order it was sent, making it the perfect protocol for transferring information like still images, data files, and web pages.

![tcp](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-I/tcp-and-udp/tcp.png)

But while TCP is instinctively reliable, its feedback mechanisms also result in a larger overhead, translating to greater use of the available bandwidth on the network.

## UDP

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simpler, connectionless internet protocol in which error-checking and recovery services are not required. With UDP, there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection. Data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether or not they receive it.

![udp](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-I/tcp-and-udp/udp.png)

It is largely preferred for real-time communications like broadcast or multicast network transmission. We should use UDP over TCP when we need the lowest latency and late data is worse than the loss of data.

## What's an API?

Before we even get into API technologies, let's first understand what is an API.

API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. It's sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user establishing the content required from the producer and the content required by the consumer.

In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and complete the request.

## REST

A [REST API](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and it was first introduced by [Roy Fielding](https://roy.gbiv.com) in the year 2000.

_In REST API, the fundamental unit is a resource._

### Concepts

Let's discuss some concepts of a RESTful API.

**Constraints**

In order for an API to be considered _RESTful_, it has to conform to these architectural constraints:

- **Uniform Interface**: There should be a uniform way of interacting with a given server.
- **Client-Server**: A client-server architecture managed through HTTP.
- **Stateless**: No client context shall be stored on the server between requests.
- **Cacheable**: Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client-side.
- **Layered system**: An application architecture needs to be composed of multiple layers.
- **Code on demand**: Return executable code to support a part of your application. _(optional)_

**HTTP Verbs**

HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as _HTTP verbs_. Each of them implements a different semantic, but some common features are shared by a group of them.

Below are some commonly used HTTP verbs:

- **GET**: Request a representation of the specified resource.
- **HEAD**: Response is identical to a `GET` request, but without the response body.
- **POST**: Submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
- **PUT**: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Applies partial modifications to a resource.

**HTTP response codes**

[HTTP response status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

There are five classes defined by the standard:

- 1xx - Informational responses.
- 2xx - Successful responses.
- 3xx - Redirection responses.
- 4xx - Client error responses.
- 5xx - Server error responses.

For example, HTTP 200 means that the request was successful.

### Advantages

Let's discuss some advantages of REST API:

- Simple and easy to understand.
- Flexible and portable.
- Good caching support.
- Client and server are decoupled.

### Disadvantages

Let's discuss some disadvantages of REST API:

- Over-fetching of data.
- Sometimes multiple round trips to the server are required.

### Use cases

REST APIs are pretty much used universally and are the default standard for designing APIs. Overall REST APIs are quite flexible and can fit almost all scenarios.

### Example

Here's an example usage of a REST API that operates on a **users** resource.

| URI           | HTTP verb | Description         |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------- |
| /users        | GET       | Get all users       |
| /users/\{id\} | GET       | Get a user by id    |
| /users        | POST      | Add a new user      |
| /users/\{id\} | PATCH     | Update a user by id |
| /users/\{id\} | DELETE    | Delete a user by id |

_There is so much more to learn when it comes to REST APIs, I will highly recommend looking into [Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)._

## GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is a query language and server-side runtime for APIs that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. It was developed by [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com) and later open-sourced in 2015.

GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. Additionally, GraphQL gives API maintainers the flexibility to add or deprecate fields without impacting existing queries. Developers can build APIs with whatever methods they prefer, and the GraphQL specification will ensure they function in predictable ways to clients.

_In GraphQL, the fundamental unit is a query._

### Concepts

Let's briefly discuss some key concepts in GraphQL:

**Schema**

A GraphQL schema describes the functionality clients can utilize once they connect to the GraphQL server.

**Queries**

A query is a request made by the client. It can consist of fields and arguments for the query. The operation type of a query can also be a [mutation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations) which provides a way to modify server-side data.

**Resolvers**

Resolver is a collection of functions that generate responses for a GraphQL query. In simple terms, a resolver acts as a GraphQL query handler.

### Advantages

Let's discuss some advantages of GraphQL:

- Eliminates over-fetching of data.
- Strongly defined schema.
- Code generation support.
- Payload optimization.

### Disadvantages

Let's discuss some disadvantages of GraphQL:

- Shifts complexity to server-side.
- Caching becomes hard.
- Versioning is ambiguous.
- N+1 problem.

### Use cases

GraphQL proves to be essential in the following scenarios:

- Reducing app bandwidth usage as we can query multiple resources in a single query.
- Rapid prototyping for complex systems.
- When we are working with a graph-like data model.

### Example

Here's a GraphQL schema that defines a `User` type and a `Query` type.

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser: User
}

type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
  city: String
  state: String
}
```

Using the above schema, the client can request the required fields easily without having to fetch the entire resource or guess what the API might return.

```graphql
{
  getUser {
    id
    name
    city
  }
}
```

This will give the following response to the client.

```json
{
  "getUser": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Karan",
    "city": "San Francisco"
  }
}
```

_Learn more about GraphQL at [graphql.org](https://graphql.org)._

### Payments

Handling payments at scale is challenging, to simplify our system we can use a third-party payment processor like [Stripe](https://stripe.com) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com). Once the payment is complete, the payment processor will redirect the user back to our application and we can set up a [webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) to capture all the payment-related data.

### Notifications

Push notifications will be an integral part of our platform. We can use a message queue or a message broker such as [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) with the notification service to dispatch requests to [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) or [Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications) which will handle the delivery of the push notifications to user devices.

_For more details, refer to the [WhatsApp](/courses/system-design/whatsapp#notifications) system design where we discuss push notifications in detail._

## Detailed design

It's time to discuss our design decisions in detail.

### Data Partitioning

To scale out our databases we will need to partition our data. Horizontal partitioning (aka [Sharding](/courses/system-design/sharding)) can be a good first step. We can shard our database either based on existing [partition schemes](/courses/system-design/sharding#partitioning-criteria) or regions. If we divide the locations into regions using let's say zip codes, we can effectively store all the data in a given region on a fixed node. But this can still cause uneven data and load distribution, we can solve this using [Consistent hashing](/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing).

_For more details, refer to [Sharding](/courses/system-design/sharding) and [Consistent Hashing](/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing)._

### Metrics and Analytics

Recording analytics and metrics is one of our extended requirements. We can capture the data from different services and run analytics on the data using [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) which is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Additionally, we can store critical metadata in the views table to increase data points within our data.

### Caching

In a location services-based platform, caching is important. We have to be able to cache the recent locations of the customers and drivers for fast retrieval. We can use solutions like [Redis](https://redis.io) or [Memcached](https://memcached.org) but what kind of cache eviction policy would best fit our needs?

**Which cache eviction policy to use?**

[Least Recently Used (LRU)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)>) can be a good policy for our system. In this policy, we discard the least recently used key first.

**How to handle cache miss?**

Whenever there is a cache miss, our servers can hit the database directly and update the cache with the new entries.

_For more details, refer to [Caching](/courses/system-design/caching)._

## Identify and resolve bottlenecks

![uber-advanced-design](/static/courses/system-design/chapter-V/uber/uber-advanced-design.png)

Let us identify and resolve bottlenecks such as single points of failure in our design:

- "What if one of our services crashes?"
- "How will we distribute our traffic between our components?"
- "How can we reduce the load on our database?"
- "How to improve the availability of our cache?"
- "How can we make our notification system more robust?"

To make our system more resilient we can do the following:

- Running multiple instances of each of our services.
- Introducing [load balancers](/courses/system-design/load-balancing) between clients, servers, databases, and cache servers.
- Using multiple read replicas for our databases.
- Multiple instances and replicas for our distributed cache.
- Exactly once delivery and message ordering is challenging in a distributed system, we can use a dedicated [message broker](/courses/system-design/message-brokers) such as [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) or [NATS](https://nats.io) to make our notification system more robust.

In November, I worked on a [new site for Request](https://request.ru). Request is an escape room company, they create, build, and host escape rooms in Moscow.

In this post, I'll share what I learned during the work and what obstacles I encountered. (Be careful: there's going to be lots of frontend terms.)

## Deadlines

We had only 3 weeks for everything 🙃

On the first week, I designed the app lifecycle, created its main frame and a set of UI components. It helped with dividing pages between team mates and launch the app in time.

## Server Site Rendering

For SEO reasons, we wanted pages with different content to have different URLs. Our project is an single page application (SPA) for we decided to use server side rendering (SSR) to solve this issue.

SSR is a technic when the server gets a request from the user, renders the page corresponding to the current URL and returns it to the user. The browser then “resurrects” the application from that page.

I already worked with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) by that time but haven't tried SSR yet. In two days I figured out how to work with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and set up the routing. I made it so the both client and the server work with the same router, so all the routing logic is collected in just one module.

## Documentation

The project is quite big, there is a team of several people working on it. For the work to go smoothly, and for the project to be consistent, I wrote documentation about it.

In the docs, I described architecture:

- how to work with the state and how to use Redux,
- how the server works,
- how to use the router;

...described the component system:

- which properties are supported by the components,
- examples of how to use components;

...described the work with the content:

- the difference between the static and dynamic content of the site,
- how to call the API server to access the dynamic content;

...described how to work with git:

- how to write commit messages,
- what to do before sending a PR,
- what open-source solutions we use and why;

...described how the project building works:

- locally,
- for testing environment,
- for production environment;

...mentioned all the obstacles we had during the development and how to avoid them.

## Open-Source Solutions

I decided what open-source components we were going to use. I looked though the components' documentation and source code to compare their public API and the code quality.

This was important because third-party code's problems were going to become our problems the same moment we would start using them.

For example, I made a mistake with a custom selector component. I took existing one but during the development I learned that it lacked some properties and it was difficult to extend its functionality. So I had to create my own selector to solve this.

## Separation and Delegation of Tasks

I was trusted to separate tasks between team members. In order to do it properly, I figured out who can handle what tasks and do it faster. I learned how to adjust a development plan and understood what an [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is.

I also learned how to read other people's code for providing quick code reviews. It turned out to be a bit harder than I initially thought 🙃

## Staging and Production Settings

I've set up project builds for staging and production server. Figured out how to work with environment variables and Node processes on different platforms.

I made it so that in the production build we have only the minified required code without subdependencies. We also send logs and errors to our own analytics server. So if there's an error in production we get an email from our mailing server.

## Conclusion

A large amount of work, unfamiliar technology, tests, code reviews, and a tight deadline added a challenge to the project. It has been one of the most intense projects for me so far. And it's cool that we were able to work out all the issues and launch the project on time.
